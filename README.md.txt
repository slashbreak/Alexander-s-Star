Features so far:
-Tracks solved/shuffled states
-playable, rotatable pieces, it's basically done.
-choice of difficulty (2 colour, 6 colour classic, and 12 colour(not sure how solvable this is))
-x,y,z object rotation, zoom, autorotate/screensaver mode
-authentic rubik's cube twist sound clips when you rotate.

To add:
-shuffler, implement a queue to 'autosolve' games
-different game mode - new rulesets
-custom face-colour options interface
-animate the faces rotating (could do with some help with this, due to its strange orientation and initial origin)
-speed mode/timer
-high scores, daily seed.

bug - textures reset when rotation has finished due to colour change code. consider preset textures for triangle pairs. also consider draw loop unrolling
